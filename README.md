1. Library Imports
Key Python libraries such as pandas, numpy, and seaborn are imported for data manipulation and visualization.​

2. Data Loading
The dataset is loaded into a pandas DataFrame. The example data contains columns for customer age and a binary target variable, bought_insurance, indicating if the customer bought insurance.​

3. Data Exploration
A preview of the dataset is shown to understand its structure. Basic exploration steps like printing the head of the DataFrame reveal the data types and sample values.​

4. Data Visualization
A scatter plot is created to visualize the relationship between age and insurance purchase status. This helps identify patterns and possible trends in the data, supporting model selection and feature analysis.​

5. Data Preparation
Input features (X) and target values (y) are defined. The features (age) are separated from the target (insurance purchase) to facilitate model training.​

6. Train-Test Split
The data is split into training and testing sets using scikit-learn’s train_test_split function. This ensures the model can be evaluated on unseen data to estimate its real-world performance.​

7. Model Training
A logistic regression model from scikit-learn is instantiated and trained using the training data. This step estimates the relationship between age and the probability of purchasing insurance.​

8. Prediction
The trained model is used to predict the insurance purchase status of customers in the test set. Predictions are generated for both the test features and individual sample(s), demonstrating how to use the model for new data.​

9. Model Evaluation
The notebook assesses model accuracy using metrics such as accuracy score, and may also include additional measures like precision, recall, or confusion matrix as appropriate. This evaluation quantifies how well the model predicts customer behavior.​

10. Results Visualization
The decision boundary and predicted probabilities can be visualized (if included in the notebook), providing insight into how the model distinguishes between customers likely to buy insurance and those who are not
